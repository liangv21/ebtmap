                    Finding a website that compiles all necessary information about SNAP and EBT -
                    where you can use it, who to contact if you have questions, and more - is difficult.
                    While the USDA Food and Nutrition Service offers a website for locating
                    nearby stores that accept SNAP/EBT and another website for more general information
                    about these resources per state, there has yet to be a tool that combines all
                    available resources together, resulting in a difficult navigation system for 
                    invididuals reliant on this program.
                    <br><br>
                    SnapMap aims to resolve this issue by collecting all of this data and putting it
                    into a single map for easy navigation. Provided a zip code, we can showcase all locations
                    within that particular zip code that accepts SNAP/EBT, as well as provide links and
                    phone numbers to governmental resources in case they need further assistance. Beyond the 
                    fundamental information of store name and address, we wanted to improve upon the
                    navigation system by providing a Google link to the location for easier navigation through
                    the tool of the user's choice. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through SnapMap, we hope to assist low-income individuals with finding the best supermarkets
                    and resources for their SNAP/EBT card, therefore resulting in significant savings, easier outreach
                    to assistance, and general convenience.
